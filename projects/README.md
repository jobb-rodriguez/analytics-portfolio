# Bike Sales Dashboard (Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Video)
Big Idea: Major Finding that's beneficial to Stakeholder

Brief Description (includes summary and tool used).

*Situation:* Clement runs an E-commerce Bike Shop. He wants to know which type of customers he should target for 2023 Q3.
1. Clement never saw the dataset for his customers. So he wants to have a general idea about them.
2. He also wants to know if income, gender, marital status, and commute distance plays a role in their purchasing decision.
3. He's also considering on which region to allocate his budget.

*Questions:*
1. What do we know about our customers based on our given data?
2. What are the traits of our ideal customer (based on income, gender, marital status, and commute distance)?
3. Which region should Clement target?

*Outputs:*
