# Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression with One Feature
# Conclusion
```Number of Convenience Stores vs Price``` had the lowest optimized cost with a relatively fair learning rate (in consideration of the other features). Moreover, the pairâ€™s optimized regression line is the nearest to the scatterplot.

As a result, Number of Convenience Stores is the best feature to predict the House Price.

# Dataset
Real estate price prediction came from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository]https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/10/automobile). [Access the file](/projects/automobile-price-prediction/car.csv).

# Data Preprocessing
In preparing the data for analysis, I perform the following preprocessing techniques with ```pandas```:
1. Categorical to Numerical Conversion
2. Drop Unused Columns
3. Add Columns: ```Volume```, ```Width ^ 2```, ```Length ^ 2```
4. Normalize the Data

# Analysis
With the available features and engineered features, I conducted Multivariate Linear Regression for comparison with ```numpy``` and plotted the results with ```matplotlib``` and ```seaborn```.

You can see me exploring the data in [Jupyter Notebooks](/projects/automobile-price-prediction/cars.ipynb).
