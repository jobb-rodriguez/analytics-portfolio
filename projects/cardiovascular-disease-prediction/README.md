# Cardiovascular Disease using Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier and Logistic Regression
# Conclusion
With or without the Body Mass Index (BMI), the first configuration was the top performing Multi-layer Perceptron classifier (MPC) configuration. Moreover, with or without BMI, the MPC outperforms Logistic Regression (LR) in the given dataset. Also, the BMI does not improve the modelsâ€™ performances.

# Dataset
The Cardiovascular Disease dataset came from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/10/automobile). [Access the file](/projects/automobile-price-prediction/car.csv).

# Analysis
I performed MPC (with three different configurations) and LR on the Data with BMI and Data without BMI. I used ```pandas```, ```numpy```, and ```scikit-learn``` (as seen in [Jupyter Notebooks](/projects/cardiovascular-disease-prediction/analysis.ipynb) and [Python](/projects/cardiovascular-disease-prediction/analysis.py)).
