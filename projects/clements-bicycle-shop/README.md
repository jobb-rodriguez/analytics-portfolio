# Big Idea
Majority of our buying customers were from North America commuting 2-5 miles and Europe commuting 0-1 miles. I recommend splitting the ad budget into 60-40. Utilize 60% targeting Middle Aged North Americans with our 2-5 miles bike. Utilize the remaining 40% targeting Middle Aged Europeans with our 0-1 miles bikes.

# Storyboard
- **Issue:** Which type of customers do we target for 2023 Q3?
- With a limited budget, we want to maximize our ROI for the next quarter.
- Marital Status and Gender did not influence the customers' purchasing decision.
- Income, age, and commute distance played a role.
- Per region, patterns appeared based on their income and commute distance.
- **Recommendation:** Target Middle Aged North Americans with our 2-5 miles bikes and Middle Aged Europeans our 0-1 miles bikes.
