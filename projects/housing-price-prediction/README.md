# Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression with One Feature
# Conclusion
```Number of Convenience Stores vs Price``` had the lowest optimized cost with a relatively fair learning rate (in consideration of the other features). Moreover, the pairâ€™s optimized regression line is the nearest to the scatterplot.

As a result, Number of Convenience Stores is the best feature to predict the House Price.

# Dataset
The Real Estate Price Prediction dataset came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/quantbruce/real-estate-price-prediction). [Access the file](/projects/housing-price-prediction/realestate.csv).

# Analysis
Per feature available, I conducted Linear Regression for comparison with ```numpy``` and plotted the results with ```matplotlib``` as seen in [```lin_reg.py```](/projects/housing-price-prediction/lin_reg.py).
